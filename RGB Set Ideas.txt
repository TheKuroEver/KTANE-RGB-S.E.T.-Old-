VISUALS:
MODULE STARTS OFF IN ALL BLACK/A SOLID COLOUR, MAYBE RANDOM? PINK LOOKS NICE.
ONCE SOLVED, THE CUBES CAN JUST VIBE.*
PERMUTATIONS MAYBE BE CONVEYED BY USE SMALLER SUB-CYCLES, FOR EACH CYCLE ALL STATIONARY CUBES HIDE INSIDE THE MODULE WHILE THE MOVING ONES CYCLE, THEN THE STATIONARY CUBES COME BACK (OR THE NEXT CYCLING ONES IF THERE ARE MORE CYCLES).
SELECTED CUBES CAN BE HIGHLIGHTED IN A DIFFERENT COLOUR (EG YELLOW) AND THEN GO GREEN IF CORRECT AND RED IF WRONG (ALL CUBES CAN BRIEFLY FLASH RED WHEN WRONG).
PRESSING THE SCREEN SHOULD TOGGLE TO SIZE VIEWING MODE: ALL CUBES GO GRAY (OR SOME NICE COLOUR) AND HAVE SOME ARRANGEMENT SHOWING ALL THREE SIZES.
